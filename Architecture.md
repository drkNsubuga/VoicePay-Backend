1. **Architecture Overview**:
   - Use AWS Lambda to handle voice commands and simulate USSD transactions.
   - Integrate AWS Transcribe for converting voice inputs to text.
   - Use AWS Lex for intent recognition (e.g., "Send Money", "Check Balance").
   - Employ AWS Polly to provide verbal feedback for user confirmations.
   - Leverage a mock database (DynamoDB or any lightweight alternative) to simulate user accounts and balances.

2. **Endpoints**:
   - `/processCommand`: Accepts recognized text from the app, determines the intent (e.g., "Send Money"), and simulates a transaction.
   - `/confirmTransaction`: Confirms and logs the transaction to the mock database.
   - `/getBalance`: Retrieves the userâ€™s balance for display in the app.

3. **Integration with Frontend**:
   - Frontend sends recognized commands to the `/processCommand` endpoint.
   - Use Axios or Fetch API in React Native to communicate with the backend.
   - Display the transaction result (success or error) based on the backend response.

4. **Security**:
   - Use AWS Cognito for user authentication and session management.
   - Implement SSL/Tecure communication between app and backend.
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user PINs) using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
